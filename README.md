# Intro-to-Programming-I-Projects
My assignments from EECS 161 written in C++

These projects range from simple assignments that just print out statements to calculators that solve integrals.

Included is our final project as well, Battleship!

## Setup

Running these projects should be fairly straight forward, simply clone this repo and open the remote directory in your terminal.
Each of these projects should compile under g++
